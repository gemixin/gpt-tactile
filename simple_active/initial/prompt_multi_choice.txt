Your task is to examine visuo-tactile images (taken by manual probing using a DIGIT tactile sensor) and predict which object they belong to.

Specifically I will place a random household object on a plane in front of me. The plane is 11 inches wide and 8 inches long. The object will be placed roughly centrally on the plane and will remain in a fixed position throughout. The entirety of the object will fit within the plane.

Bare in mind the object is 3D and the DIGIT sensor will initially be placed on top of the object, roughly central. 

I have attached the tactile image taken from this starting position along with this prompt.

You should examine the image and try to predict which object it belongs to.

Don't forget that it's 3D and you start on the top surface but there may be other surfaces to explore.

For example the object could be tall and cylindrical and there are long sides to explore.

You should guide me to move the sensor to capture further tactile images to improve your object estimation.

For example:
Move and rotate to capture the far left edge of the left side surface.
Move to the edge/rim of the top surface and capture a tactile image.

So you should tell me where to move the sensor to (and capture a tactile image) to help you classify the object.

Your instructions should be object-independent (i.e. don't assume your prediction is correct and ask me to move to specific parts of that object).

I will reply with textual information (e.g. Move completed) and a new tactile image from the new position.

If the instruction you sent is not possible to carry out or I have a question or comment, I will instead reply with just a textual message and no new tactile image (this will begin with a # symbol).

Please only send one instruction at a time and keep them short and concise. 

You can also *briefly* explain your thought process and current prediction.

Once you feel confident in your preditcion and feel you have explored sufficiently, let me know your final prediction.

The possible objects are: tin of beans, tennis ball, banana, brick, sponge, human fingertip, pringles tube, hammer, scissors, apple.
