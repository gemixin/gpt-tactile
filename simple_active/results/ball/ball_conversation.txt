Initial multi-choice prompt and initial tactile image sent.

Quick thought: the contact looks soft/irregular (not a sharp hard rim or clear fingerprint), so my top guesses are sponge, apple, or tennis ball — but I'm unsure.

Please move the sensor from the current central spot about 1–2 cm outward toward the object's top edge (i.e., so the probe contacts nearer the rim/edge of the top surface) and capture another tactile image.

Ok

Brief thought: the contact looks soft and fibrous/porous — sponge is my top guess, with tennis ball or apple less likely.

Please slide the sensor outward so it crosses the top edge onto the object's side, then capture a tactile image of the side about 1–2 cm down from the top edge.

Ok

-----
Brief thought: textures still look soft and porous — sponge remains my top guess.

Please slide the sensor further down the same side until you reach the bottom edge where the object meets the plane (so the probe contacts the object's side and the plane at the base), then capture one tactile image.

Ok

-----
Brief thought: the images still show a soft, porous texture — sponge is still most likely.

Please move the sensor completely off the object onto the bare plane (right next to the object's base) and capture one tactile image for background comparison.
-----
# Should the sensor be pressed against the plane or just 'mid-air'?
-----
Press gently so the sensor contacts the plane (do not hold it mid‑air). Use a similar downward force as your previous touches, avoid sliding, and place it right next to the object’s base. Then capture the tactile image.
-----
Ok

Brief thought: the contacts look consistently soft and porous — sponge remains my leading guess.

Please move the sensor to the opposite side of the object (across from your previous side touches) and press about halfway down that side (mid-height), then capture one tactile image.
-----
Ok

Brief thought: the contact looks soft and porous, so sponge is still my top guess — but I need to test compressibility to rule out soft fruit (apple/banana) versus foam.

Please press down more firmly (greater downward force than prior touches) at the top center of the object (where you first started) — enough to cause noticeable deformation if it’s soft — and capture one tactile image.

Brief thought: the contacts still look soft/porous — sponge is my leading guess but I need to know if there’s a sharp edge or a gradual boundary.

Starting from your current spot, slide the sensor straight outward until it crosses the object’s rim onto the plane; capture one tactile image right when you first touch the plane (i.e., at the edge crossing).

# The shape of the object doesn't allow for this

Thanks — that’s fine.

Brief thought: textures still point to a soft, porous material (sponge) but I want information about the object's rim/curvature to rule out spherical/rounded fruits.

Instruction: place the sensor on the top surface as close to the object's edge as you can without crossing off (about 1 cm from the rim), press gently, and capture one tactile image.
-----
# Should I keep the sensor flat or move to follow the object shape?
-----
Keep the sensor flat (same orientation as your earlier touches) and press straight down with similar gentle force — do not tilt to follow curvature or slide. Then place it about 1 cm from the rim on the top surface and capture one tactile image.

Brief thought: still leaning toward sponge, but an edge image will help confirm whether the boundary is sharp (brick/box) or soft/rounded (sponge/fruit).

Brief thought: images look porous and compressible — sponge is my top guess but I want to confirm compressibility on the side.

Instruction: press firmly (more downward force than before) on the object's side at mid‑height (same spot you used earlier on that side) and capture one tactile image.

Ok

Brief thought: texture still looks porous and compressible — rotating the sensor while in contact can reveal directional structure (fibers vs smooth skin).

Instruction: press at the top-center of the object, then rotate the sensor ~45° clockwise while maintaining contact (no sliding), and capture one tactile image.

Ok

Brief thought: images still suggest a soft, porous surface — sponge is my top guess but sliding can reveal rough/fibrous vs smooth skin.

Instruction: press gently at the top center, then while maintaining contact, slide the sensor slowly about 1–2 cm in a straight line (no rotation). Capture one tactile image after the slide.

Ok

Brief thought: the surface still appears soft and porous — sponge remains my top guess but I want a clearer test of how the material shears.

Please press firmly on the object's side near the base and, while maintaining contact, slide the sensor slowly about 1 cm along the side (no rotation). Capture one tactile image.

Brief thought: the surface looks porous and compressible — sponge is my top guess with moderate confidence.

Instruction: press very firmly at the top-center (more force than previous touches), hold for 2–3 seconds to cause noticeable deformation if soft, then capture one tactile image.
-----
Ok

Final prediction: sponge (high confidence).

Reasoning: all tactile images show a soft, porous, fibrous texture and consistent compressibility under increased downward force and sliding — unlike smooth skin (apple/banana) or hard edges (brick/hammer/tin). Surface feels uniform, not hairy or ridged (ruling out fingertip, scissors, tennis ball seam). 

If you’d like, I can suggest one last check (e.g., press firmly at an exposed corner to confirm a soft sharp edge) before you reveal the object.
