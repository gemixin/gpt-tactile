Initial multi-choice prompt and initial tactile image sent.

Initial impression: the image shows smooth, concentric curved ridges consistent with a human fingerprint or a curved smooth surface (e.g., fingertip). I’m tentatively guessing human fingertip but not certain.

Please move the sensor a small amount (about 5–10 mm) toward the top edge of the current contact area (away from the center) and capture a new tactile image.

Ok

Current thought: both images show smooth, curved, fine ridge patterns — consistent with a fingertip but could also be a small curved object. To check scale and curvature, please move the sensor ~8–10 mm to the left (relative to the current contact) and capture one new tactile image.

Ok

Brief thought: the textures look like fine, parallel, curved ridges — strongly suggestive of a human fingertip but not yet confirmed. To check curvature/scale and see if ridges end at an edge, move the sensor about 8–12 mm toward the bottom-right from the current contact and capture one new tactile image.

Current prediction: human fingertip (high likelihood based on curved, fine ridges), but I want to confirm an edge or nail.

Please move the sensor ~8–12 mm toward the top edge of the current contact area (i.e., away from the center) to try to reach a boundary, and capture one new tactile image.

Ok

Current thought: the curved, fine parallel ridges strongly suggest a human fingertip, but I want to confirm a hard boundary (nail or cuticle).

Please move the sensor ~8–12 mm continuing outward from the top edge you just reached (i.e., further away from the center) to try to reach the outer boundary, and capture one new tactile image.

Brief thought: the fine, curved parallel ridges strongly support "human fingertip" (high likelihood), but I want to confirm an outer boundary (nail or fingertip edge).

Please move the sensor about 8–12 mm to the left from the current contact point and capture one new tactile image.

Ok

Current thought: the images show fine, curved parallel ridges and strong curvature — strongly suggestive of a human fingertip (high likelihood). To confirm an outer boundary or different texture, move the sensor about 8–12 mm downward (toward the bottom of the current contact area) and capture one new tactile image.

-----
Current prediction: human fingertip (high confidence) based on curved, fine ridge patterns and strong local curvature.

Please move the sensor ~10–15 mm farther downward (toward the bottom edge of the current contact area) to try to reach the fingertip boundary or nail, and capture one new tactile image.

Final prediction: human fingertip — high confidence.

Reasoning: all captured contacts show fine, closely spaced curved parallel ridges and strong small-radius curvature consistent with fingerprint skin. Textures and scale do not match the alternatives (no porous sponge pores, no fuzzy tennis-ball nap, no hard rim of a tin/Pringles/hammer, no smooth peel of a banana, etc.).

If you want, I can continue exploring toward the nail edge to absolutely confirm, but I’m confident with this prediction.
