Initial multi-choice prompt and initial tactile image sent.
-----
Brief thought: the tactile image shows a smooth, low-frequency imprint with no sharp ridges or regular texture — suggests a smooth curved top (e.g., apple or tennis ball) rather than a flat metal rim, sponge pores, or fingerprint. Current best guess: apple (but tennis ball is also possible).

Next move (one step): shift the sensor ~1–2 cm toward the object's left edge while staying on the top surface (so you capture the top edge/rim area) and take a new tactile image.
-----
Ok

-----
Brief thought: images look like a smooth, curved imprint — likely a round object (apple or tennis ball). Need side details to tell skin/fuzz or seam/dimple.

Next move: slide the sensor ~1–2 cm toward the object’s edge so it crosses the top-to-side boundary (feel for the curvature change), press and capture one tactile image.
-----
Ok
captures/frame_3.jpg attached.
-----
Brief thought: the new image shows a curved, raised seam-like line — this points toward a tennis ball (seam + curved shape). Current prediction: tennis ball (not certain).

Next move: move the sensor further off the top onto the side (~2–3 cm), then slide it vertically along the side (top-to-bottom) and capture one tactile image.
-----
Ok

-----
Brief thought: the curved dark line seen earlier looks like a seam — that points toward a tennis ball, but I need texture detail (fuzz vs smooth skin) to be confident.

Next move: shift the sensor ~1–2 cm to the right (along that dark curved line) and capture a tactile image.
-----
Ok

-----
Brief thought: the curved dark line looks like a seam — that strongly suggests a tennis ball, but I need surface texture (fuzz vs smooth skin) to be sure.

Next move: shift the sensor ~1 cm so the curved dark line (seam) lies near the center of the sensor, press once and capture a tactile image.
-----
Ok

-----
Brief thought: the curved dark crescent seen in several images looks like a seam or edge — that narrows things toward a rounded object with a seam, but I still can’t tell if the surface is fuzzy (tennis ball) or smooth (other round objects).

Next move: while keeping contact, move the sensor ~5–10 mm perpendicular across that curved line (a short lateral rub across the seam) and then capture one tactile image.
-----
Ok

-----
Brief thought: the repeated curved seam strongly points to a tennis ball, but I still lack surface texture or a flat base check.

Current prediction: tennis ball (provisional).

Next move: move the sensor down to the area where the object meets the plane (the base/edge) and capture one tactile image.
-----
# It already does meet the plane
-----
Brief thought: the curved seam seen across images still points toward a rounded object with a seam (tennis ball is likely).

Next move: move the sensor ~1–2 cm off the object onto the plane (away from the object) and capture one tactile image.
-----
# I don't understand
-----
Brief thought: still leaning tennis ball.

Clarification: please lift the sensor clear of the object and place it on the bare plane about 1–2 cm away from the object's edge (so the sensor is touching only the plane), then capture one tactile image. This gives a background reference.
-----
Ok

-----
Brief thought: the object images show a clear curved seam and smooth overall curvature — leaning toward tennis ball, but I still need evidence of a fuzzy surface (high-frequency texture) versus smooth skin.

Next move: place the sensor back on the top/sidelap near that curved seam and slowly slide it ~1 cm laterally (a gentle rub across the surface) then capture one tactile image.
-----
# I suggest you explore the right edge of the object instead
-----
Brief thought: I still favor tennis ball (curved shape + seam), but need texture at the right edge to confirm.

Next move: shift the sensor ~1–2 cm toward the object’s rightmost edge until you cross the top-to-side boundary (feel the curvature change), press and capture one tactile image.
-----
It was more than 1-2cm but here is the right edge

-----
Brief thought: the images still show a smooth curved surface with a repeating curved feature; I’m still leaning toward tennis ball (seam on a rounded, slightly soft object).

Next move: move the sensor downward along the object’s side toward the plane (so you traverse from top → side → where the object meets the plane), press and capture one tactile image.
-----
Ok

-----
Brief thought: the repeated curved ridge strongly suggests a seam on a rounded object — I still favor tennis ball (provisional).

Next move: from the current spot, keep contact and make a short lateral sweep (~5–10 mm) across the side (perpendicular to the curved ridge), then capture one tactile image.
-----
Ok

-----
Brief thought: the repeated curved ridge/line strongly suggests a seam on a rounded object — my current prediction is tennis ball (provisional).

Next move: while keeping the sensor over that curved ridge (seam), make a short circular rub (clockwise, ~5–10 mm radius) centered on the seam and capture one tactile image.
-----
Ok
captures/frame_12.jpg attached.
-----
Brief thought: the strong curved ridge (seam) and rounded impressions make a tennis ball the leading candidate (moderate-high confidence).

Next move: press a bit firmer and slowly drag the sensor ~1–2 cm across the seam (perpendicular to the ridge) to emphasize any fine surface texture, then capture one tactile image.
-----
Ok

-----
Final prediction: tennis ball (high confidence).

Reasoning: across multiple touches I repeatedly see a smooth, rounded imprint with a distinctive continuous curved ridge/seam running across the surface. That seam + overall rounded geometry matches a tennis ball and rules out flat/edged objects (brick, tin, pringles tube, hammer), thin objects (scissors), or distinctly textured surfaces (sponge, fingertip). An apple would show a central dimple or different curvature/texture; I did not observe that.

If you’d like, I can suggest one last check to be absolutely certain (e.g., press and rub across the seam to reveal any fuzz texture), otherwise I’ll stick with tennis ball.
